# Desktop AI Chatbot

## Project Overview
Desktop AI Chatbot is a Windows desktop application that integrates voice user interface (VUI) technologies with advanced language processing models. This allows users to interact with their computer through voice commands and receive audio responses from the AI. The bot can perform a variety of tasks ranging from simple informational queries to system operations.

## Features
- **Voice Command Recognition**: Users can interact with the chatbot using natural speech.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Response**: The chatbot responds to queries audibly, making the interaction more engaging and accessible.
- **Integration with Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Leverages state-of-the-art AI models to understand and generate human-like text responses.
- **Task Automation**: Capable of performing system tasks such as opening files, managing applications, and fetching web data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For core application logic and integration with APIs.
- **Speech Recognition and TTS Libraries**: To enable voice input and output.
- **GUI Framework**: (e.g., PyQt or Tkinter) for creating the application interface.
